lecture presents an overview of evolutionary biology and its two major
components, microevolution and macroevolution. The idea of evolution
goes back before Darwin, although Darwin thought of natural selection.
Evolution is driven by natural selection, the correlation between
organism traits and reproductive success, as well as random drift. The
history of life goes back approximately 3.7 billion years to a common
ancestor, and is marked with key events that affect all
life."},"course":{"name":"Evolution, Ecology and

"description":"This course presents the principles of evolution,
ecology, and behavior for students beginning their study of biology and
of the environment. It discusses major ideas and results in a manner
accessible to all Yale College undergraduates. Recent advances have
energized these fields with results that have implications well beyond
their boundaries: ideas, mechanisms, and processes that should form part
of the toolkit of all biologists and educated
citizens."},"university":{"name":"Yale","link":"http://www.academicearth.org/universities/yale"},"subject":{"name":"\u000a\u0009Biology","link":"http://www.academicearth.org/subjects/biology"}}
